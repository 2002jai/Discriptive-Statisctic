## Introduction

Descriptive statistics is a fundamental branch of statistics that deals with summarizing and describing data. This repository provides a comprehensive guide to various topics in descriptive statistics.

## Measures of Central Tendency

### Mean (Average)

Explanation and calculation of the mean as a measure of central tendency.

### Median

Understanding and computing the median as a central tendency measure.

### Mode

Exploring the mode as a measure of central tendency, especially for categorical data.

## Measures of Dispersion

### Range

Calculation and interpretation of the range as a measure of data spread.

### Variance

Understanding variance as a measure of data variability.

### Standard Deviation

Explanation and computation of the standard deviation as a measure of data dispersion.

### Interquartile Range (IQR)

Defining and using the interquartile range to measure the spread of data.

## Measures of Shape

### Skewness

Interpreting skewness as a measure of data asymmetry.

### Kurtosis

Understanding kurtosis as a measure of data's tail behavior.

## Probability Distributions

### Normal Distribution

Exploring the characteristics and properties of the normal distribution.

### Binomial Distribution

Understanding and using the binomial distribution for discrete data.

### Poisson Distribution

Exploring the Poisson distribution and its applications.

## Data Visualization

### Histograms

Creating and interpreting histograms to visualize data distributions.

### Box Plots

Understanding box plots and using them to visualize data outliers.

### Probability Plots

Visualizing data distribution using probability plots.

## Sampling and Confidence Intervals
